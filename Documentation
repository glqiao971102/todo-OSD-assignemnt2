Our first goal was to put the things we learned in GWG together to create something useful in the daily life.
the second goal was to learn GitHub.

HTML:
------
The html is simple, we used input fields that have the Id's #myItem for the grocery item and  #quantity for the quanitity needed .And the select option for the unit, it has the Id #unit.
We also have a button and the UL with the id #myUL and this is where the javascript is going to add the items.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The JavaScript:
---------------
We used Jquery in our project, the functions we wrote in the code are:

addListItem()
-------------
After defining the variables, it checks if the input field is empty or it has a number instead of an item and gives the user a message to put an item .

Now there's a shoppingItem, we have 2 if statements , the first one makes sure the quantity is >0 , the second checks the unit, if the unit is not blank it puts it in () and if it is blank then no need for the ().

the ShoppingItem is added as a li inside of the html UL (we use the id #myUL to find the ul in the html) 
When the shopping item is added, with ech item added there's alsoa checbox(to strike out the done items) and a delete button(to delete items)


doneBuyItem() 
--------------
The job of this function is to toggle a CSS calss called .strike , this class is responsible of striking out the item the user already bought and make its color red.


deleteItem()
------------
it hides the li that has the item in


the last function includes what happens when we click the buttons or the checkbox:
  $(function(){
    $("#add").on("click", addListItem); /*when we click the button and item is added*/
    $(document).on('click','.itemDone', doneBuyItem); /*when we click the checkbox the doneBuyItem strikes out the item and makes it red */
     $(document).on('click','.delete', deleteItem);/*when we click the small x button next to the item the deleteItem() works */
  });

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CSS
------
All the styling and classes go in the CSS .
