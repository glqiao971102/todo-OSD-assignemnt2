# My Grocery List group project for (Grow With Google Scholarship - Udacity)
Hello and welcome to the My Grocery List small project
This project is about creating a Javascript grocery List where we can add items to the list and then check the items we already bought, the checked item need to look different so we know it is checked. we need also the ability to delete items from the list, so it is all about Add Delete and check items.
We'll add more features in the future.
